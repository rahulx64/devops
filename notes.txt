--------------------part 1- -----------virtual machine-------------------
hperviser is like help us run multiple os on s single machine like one is native hyperviser and one is like on the top of hyperviser you can understadn by watching a single machine 

use command ipconfig to get get information about 

i use vagrant clud to install various os or virtual machine according to our need and fix it 

------------>learning linux ---------------

linux principle every thing is file 

debian based os and rpm based os 
rpm based used on seervers and 
debian based is more of using it in day to day life 

go a virtual machine file and run this commmand to run the virtual machine 
{vagrant up
vagrant ssh    /// to get into shell '

whoami
cat /etc/os-release

cd /   -for root in vagrant os


sudo -i to get into root  shell 

touch x.txt  to start file

exit   > to move otuside root

thse command mostly we use to handle file in linux 
 77  pwd
   78  touch testfile1.txt
  125  history
  127  whoami
  128  pwd
  129  cd /
  130  pwd
  131  ls
  132  cat /etc/os-release

   sudo yum install vim -y

vagrant global-status
to check which desktop is running on our sysytem

vim firstfile.txt  
 }

 types of files in linux 
🗒️ Notes on:
drwxr-xr-x. 2 vagrant vagrant 6 Nov  1 09:05 backupdir


d → This is a directory.

rwxr-xr-x → Permissions:

Owner: rwx → read, write, execute (full access)

Group: r-x → read, execute only

Others: r-x → read, execute only

. → SELinux security context is active.

2 → Number of links (for directories, usually 2 = . and ..).

vagrant (user) → Owner of the directory.

vagrant (group) → Group that owns it.

6 → Size of the directory in bytes.

Nov 1 09:05 → Last modification date and time.

backupdir → Directory name.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
nano x.txt is default text edior in linux based os but 
vim is new one 


filters in linux
🧩 What is a filter in Linux?

In Linux (including CentOS), a filter is simply a command-line program that takes input, processes it, and produces output.
Filters are often used in pipelines (connected by the | operator), where the output of one command becomes the input of another.

cat file.txt
head -n 5 file.txt
-------------------------redirectin-----
🧭 What is Redirection?

Redirection in Linux means changing where input and output go.

Normally:

Input comes from your keyboard.

Output goes to your screen (terminal).

With redirection, you can:

Send output to a file instead of the screen.

Take input from a file instead of the keyboard.

Combine or separate standard output and error output.

-----------------sudo--------------------
🔐 What is sudo in Linux?

sudo means “superuser do”.
It allows a regular (non-root) user to run commands with root (administrator) privileges.

You use sudo when you need to:

install software

modify system files

add/remove users

start/stop system services

change system configuration

access protected directories

Without sudo → "Permission denied"
With sudo → Command runs as root

----------package management -----------------
yum and dnf based is used to manage package in fedora baased linux os and apt is used for ubunutu bassed linux os 

to get package 
wget https://rpmfind.net/linux/centos-stream/9-stream/AppStream/x86_64/os/Packages/httpd-2.4.62-7.el9.x86_64.rpm

modern way to install  package softwaare is 
yum search package x
yum install pacakge x 
after we hit this commmand packaage and its dependenicies is installed accordingly 

dnf install httpd -y

installing jenkins 

sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
sudo yum upgrade
# Add required dependencies for the jenkins package
sudo yum install fontconfig java-21-openjdk
sudo yum install jenkins
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

systemctl start httpd
systemctl stop httpd
systemctl enable httpd

=============================================================================
apache tomcat service 
i want to know some answer 

tomcat is java based http server  

if sytem ctl service is not working what we can do is we can get it throggh wget or other serives after getting we can do is 
we need to other way to start this services and stop this serivces if possible 
>
---=========================================================----->
in terminal we can store value in shell in this way 
x=12
to get value 
echo $X

can do basic handling like for loop ifelse variable store and more

so the project i am working i would like to say is i am uusing 
nginx --->apache tomcat-->rabbitMQ -->memecache-->mysql


network file system  (multiple server can read and access simple file system )

## vagrant-hostmanager-end
lets say if your all your vm is runnign and working propelry you need to do is  yoou need to check wherather 
you can transfer data from 
current login vm to vmx
here is the command 
ping app01 -c 4 ******

--------------------nentwrking in devops how we handle it manually -------------------------

after sudo -i

ip addr show
ping  ipaddreess command to help us chk wheather datat is sending to the given location  
ping google.com
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8    #= send 4 ICMP echo requests
tracert google.com   #= to trace path
curl https://google.com   ==help us download 
wget https://example.com/file.tar.gz
again to download 
netstat -antp
nmap  localhost 
dig www.google.com  to chek ip address of host 
route -n 
arp  
mtr   is just like trace route with more information 
telnet  ip

----------------------container------------------------

rather than in a virtual machine where each vm linux host a service and each service has its own kernel but in the the case of in docker each serivce has same kernel but different file structure realted to a particluar service okay now you might get it 

cp x y 


--------------------aws-------------
there are 172 seriveces in aws but 

#1 ec2 service  elastic compute cloud 
it contain ami,instance type ,amazon elastic block store(ebs)
it contan ami amazon virtual image it is jsut like vagrant iage for lightweight hosting of ervice 


aws ~/.aws/  it give information about hidden files and tilda means home directory 

aws ec2 describe-instances
 some cls command
 i have complented ec2 serivce

 and iam serivice
